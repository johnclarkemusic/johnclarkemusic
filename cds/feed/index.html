					<description><![CDATA[John, we discovered you 5 years ago along pier 39 while on our Honeymoon. Your music is mesmerizing , and we just fell in love with it. We bought a couple of CDs and have enjoyed playing them thru the years. What day(s) is the best chance of still catching a live performance. Where? ,......still by pier 39? Or have you moved on. 
Blessings to you Sir, and thanks for your gift of music you share<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2757.png" alt="‚ùó" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="üëç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello and thank you for the music! I have listened to you from afar (Idaho) for several years, ever since someone told me about your Acoustik album, which I bought from iTunes and have enjoyed since. It was infinitely more rewarding, however, to be in San Francisco for a conference, walking along the waterfront for the first time, where my mother was about 60 years ago, only to hear the sounds of your guitar floating above it all. I am so glad to have purchased your String and Wood album, although I should have purchased Waterfront too! Take care, and thanks for all the music!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnclarkemusic.com/cds/comment-page-4/#comment-29479&quot;&gt;John H. Clarke&lt;/a&gt;.

Just saw this post... As someone who is Chinese and loves your music, I‚Äôd love to try to contact NetEastMusic (also known in Chinese as ÁΩëÊòì‰∫ëÈü≥‰πê) on your behalf if you want them to ask for your authorization but don‚Äôt have a better approach.
I‚Äôm not sure if you can see the email address I left when I was posting this comment, if you can, please contact me and I‚Äôd love to help in any possible way.
