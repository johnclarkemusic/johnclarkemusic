					<description><![CDATA[Many thanks for this video. It&#039;s a very nice composition, like all your guitar music. But I saw your fingers move over the Guitar strings and my head spins. But I hope, this is not your last instrumental.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good thing you didn&#039;t tell me the price.  Otherwise I might not be able to resist to pun you that you meant prize.  In that case, hm... no, not enough.  That&#039;s what your pricing means in Cantonese if I were to pun you.

I like your other YouTube version of the same piece.  Sounds so happy and boyish.  When I heard that version I really could relate your piece to a walk to a lake.]]></description>
