					<description><![CDATA[Hello John, I just want to say that I really miss the live stream show.  I understand if you are not going to be doing this anymore.  However, your fans love you, and miss you very much.  Thank you for all the wonderful times you have given us, and all you have shared with us.  It has been a great journey.  I hope to see you again on a live stream.  I want to wish you all of God&#039;s greatest blessings.  Peace and joy, be with you, always.  
Thank you, John,
