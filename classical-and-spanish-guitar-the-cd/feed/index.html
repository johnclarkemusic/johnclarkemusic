					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been passionate about acoustic guitar, specifically Spanish/Flamenco style. So, I ran a search and found you. What an amazing musician you are. I could just sit in front on my computer and watch/listen to you all day. Are you scheduling any tours? Come to Northern California why don&#039;t you!
If you have a mailing list/newsletter for your fans to let them know when new cd&#039;s are release or where you&#039;ll be playing, please add my name and address.
God bless and play on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John,
I have always played around with guitar but mostly into sax and harmonica. I was bored last night and pulled up Spanish guitar music and you popped up. Now I it&#039;s imperative that I learn how to play like you. Do you have instructional videos for sale. If so, I want to get as much help as I can to impress my wife and all my employees here at Starlight Mfg. You&#039;re the man!! 1-800-223-1752]]></description>
