					<description><![CDATA[John,
I listened to your music briefly this evening at the Wharf and your latin melody brought a inner peace and cheer to my heart. I bought your two CD&#039;s and look forward to listening to them. Your passion for music and love you have for performing is evident and not sure why your are not a fanous performer in the world of music. I have listened for more than 40 years to street performers and musicians in general and i must say that you sparked something in me that I&#039;m not sure what will come of it as yet.
Mucho gusto!
