					<description><![CDATA[I think this piece means something completely different to you than it means to me.  To me it&#039;s uplifting.  Actually tried listening to this piece while reading a poem that I felt somehow went well with it.  It&#039;s probably the percussive taps at the first &quot;F&quot; and &quot;E&quot; of each triplet after a series of &quot;triplet triads&quot; in the A section that remind me of the iambic meter, of how English poetry sounds like.  
It&#039;s that hope and a kind of lively passion I hear from this music that makes it special to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love your playing!!
My 13 year old son has been studying classical guitar for many years.  He was starting to drift to other styles of music.   We both love The Most Evolved, and that got him re-interested in his classical guitar (yay!!).
Thanks for sharing your talent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, You are a great musician and composer, you have a special gift in your heart, in your mind and in your hands, mostly in your heart, because you force and feeling to playguitar, the inspiration to compose and the good person that you are came from your heart. Don&#039;t forget that. In a World where just the 3% of the population are musicians, you are special, at the end of everything and at the beginning of all. You will be special and that makes you  The most Evolved.]]></description>
