					<description><![CDATA[Hello Johh! I experienced your beautiful music on the street yesterday in San Francisco at fishermans wharf, and it absolutely made my day! My sister and I were right in front of you and  completely felt serenaded by your amazing talent!  Your music touched my heart and my soul and seeing you feel the music reminds me of how I feel when I play my saxophone. I loved the influence you had on the crowd of people and everything about the ambiance your environment around you creates. My grandfather could play every instrument and seeing you touched my heart and soul in a way I&#039;ll never forget, thank you for the beauty you bring to the streets!  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Hope to see you again and experience your amazing talent some day soon!]]></description>
