					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
IT has been some time. I recently started trying to learn Libretango.  I saw a couple of cool videos of a guitar playing it. I thought of you and thought I would ask if you would make a video about how to play it. Then better yet, I wondered if you could compose something like Libretango, it seems to be a cool, rhythmic, passionate song.   Thanks for sharing your talent.]]></description>
