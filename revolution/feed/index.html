					<description><![CDATA[A friend introduced me to a few of your videos on youtube and I can&#039;t get enough! I could watch/listen to you play for days. Being an avid music lover myself, your love of music shines through your playing and is easily recognized!! I plan on buying your CD and will one day be able to attend one of your public shows (I live in South Carolina). Thank you so much for sharing your talent with the world. I, for one, am touched deeply.

Always,
Amy Still]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John,
Never say that you will never be the best guitarist... To my ears, you are!  It is subjective anyway;

An old proverb;
The bird that says it cannot reach the highest limb of the tree, will never know how sweet it&#039;s fruit taste!

By the way, I love the guitar and scratch plate engravings...
