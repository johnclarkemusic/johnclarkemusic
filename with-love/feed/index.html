					<description><![CDATA[Searching for music to use for work with my Spanish horses I discovered you on youtube ... and I have to say: you got a new fan! your music makes my skin crawl! Please tell me how I can get some of your CDs (maybe even trough your web, sorry, I´m so overwhelmed, I just did´t look) and whether it would be ok for you if I use some of your pieces to show my horses. Thanks , Dori]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love to with love, it&#039;s great, I have no credit card will send a letter to pay the tabs with love, but I have doubts about is what I have to send money and in terms of dollar or peso or dollar serious Mexican currency and that mail can get through faster and safer, whether sent by courier or DHL, or that I recommended.

Thank you very much and thank you for your attention.]]></description>

Thanks you very much for your compliments. I am sorry that the video is not viewable in Germany. Is that still the case? Hopefully not, I opted out of youtube partner program which means no more advertisements on my videos. Maybe that is why youtube was blocking it.]]></description>
