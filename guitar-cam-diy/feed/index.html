					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;d love to see a guitar cam mount tutorial too. I&#039;ve got a GoPro Hero 2 that fits onto my surfboards with mounts backed with 3M VHB adhesive, but I don&#039;t wanna wreck my Strat or Gibson SG (or other guitars) with adhesive!! I&#039;m thinking of sticking a little 3M Dual Lock onto the bottom of the camera, and then some more onto either a guitar capo or a Velcro band with a straight, hard section for the Dual Lock. 
Any thoughts on this mad method??]]></description>

@Don
Do you have any pictures online, or a video of your design in action?  I&#039;d love to see it. One of the advantages of the design I show how to make above, is that it is very strong and rigid.  The camera will not shake...which means a better video effect.  All my new videos use it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would love to see this tutorial, mate. Seems like you&#039;ve picked up a lot of useful techniques and methods in your time in Mexico :). Or maybe it was just your ingenuity?]]></description>
