					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I&#039;m an electric guitar player, and I have just stumbled on your website in an attempt to rig a fretcam. I like your design, I&#039;ll see if I can fashion one for an electric guitar, which mostly doesn&#039;t have much room on the headstock. 

Your music btw is loads of awesome and amazing rolled in one!

Thanks,
Joe]]></description>
