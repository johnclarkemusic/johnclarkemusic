					<description><![CDATA[Hello John; I stumbled on your YouTube videos while seeking instruction on &#039;Spanish Romance&#039;. The tune has plagued me all through my life so I feel I must try and learn it but I realize it will take some time. Your instruction on your tune &#039;To Live&#039; is amazing. I finally put it together after a few tries but found the steel strings hurt my pinky. Better get out my classical guitar as opposed to my J45. When I feel encouraged by my progress, I&#039;ll purchase some of your product. Keep up the good work and I thank you......Ron.]]></description>
