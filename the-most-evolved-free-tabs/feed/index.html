					<description><![CDATA[Hi John!

I would like to know it punctually, a what kind of guitar you use in the video, in which you got dressed so, than the guy in the convict conditioning.
I love the way it sounds, and I will buy a classic guitar these days.

Thank&#039;s for your help! You are a really motivating person!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Clark,

My name is TJ Rice.  I am 3 years old, and my daddy teaches Spanish.  He likes to show me videos about Spanish things on the computer, and he showed me your video of The Most Evolved.  

I like your music!  I sit watching your videos over and over again.  I even started playing the guitar like you.  Well, it&#039;s a splatter guard for daddy&#039;s frying pan, but it&#039;s a guitar to me.

I&#039;m even thinking of doing a video!

Thank you, Mr. Clark, for your lovely music!

					<description><![CDATA[After listening to various guitarists (especially those who concentrate in performing traditional compositions for guitar) makes me appreciate your style a bit more.  You seem to constantly try to find ways to refresh and improve your songs.  I just wished that all these subtleties were articulated in your music sooner, but these differences do provide new perspective.  Really wasn&#039;t that easy to get your &quot;Acoustik Guitar&quot; from where I am, but it was well worth it.]]></description>
