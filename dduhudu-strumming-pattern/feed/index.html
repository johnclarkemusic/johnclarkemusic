					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for what you do.  I have been playing guitar a couple of years.  I dont like using a pick and was digging through youtube looking for some finger picking lessons or ideas.  I found &quot;The Most Evolved&quot; and was amazed.  I immediatley downloaded your Acoustik Guitar CD from Amazon.  I play an Ibanez AE and am looking for a classical guitar to continue this newfound journey.  Its too bad South GA is nowhere near Berkley, CA.  Thanks again.  Jon]]></description>
