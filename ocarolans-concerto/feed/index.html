					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John. It is always such a pleasure listening to you play. I have been wanting to learn more guitar but it seems I can&#039;t seem to practice consistently. I play the violin but enjoy the guitar very much also. Keep up the good work.

God Bless!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[=)

The tutorial&#039;s too advanced for me.  I don&#039;t play guitar.  I don&#039;t know that much about fretboard either, or how guitarists typically practice scales.  But it was fun to watch.]]></description>
